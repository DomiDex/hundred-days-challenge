## üö® Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**
   - Monitor security alerts
   - Check logs for anomalies
   - User reports

2. **Containment**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Block malicious IPs
   - Disable compromised accounts

3. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs
   - Identify attack vector
   - Assess damage

4. **Remediation**
   - Fix vulnerabilities
   - Update security measures
   - Deploy patches

5. **Recovery**
   - Restore services
   - Verify integrity
   - Monitor closely

6. **Post-Incident**
   - Document findings
   - Update procedures
   - Share lessons learned

## üìä Security Metrics

Monitor these key metrics:

- Authentication failure rate
- Rate limit violations
- CSP violations
- 4xx/5xx error rates
- Response times
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Time to patch

## üîß Security Tools

- **npm audit**: Dependency scanning
- **Dependabot**: Automated updates
- **DOMPurify**: XSS prevention
- **Zod**: Input validation
- **Upstash**: Rate limiting
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Secret scanning
