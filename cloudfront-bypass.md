# CloudFront 403 Error - Advanced Solutions

## The Issue

CloudFront (Amazon's CDN) is blocking your access to Prismic, likely due to:

- Rate limiting
- Geographic restrictions
- Security rules triggering false positives
- Cookie/session issues

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Browser Reset (Most Effective)

```bash
# For Chrome on Windows
1. Close Chrome completely
2. Press Win+R, type: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data
3. Rename "Default" folder to "Default_backup"
4. Restart Chrome (creates fresh profile)
```

### 2. Alternative Browsers (Order of likelihood to work)

1. **Microsoft Edge** (often works when Chrome doesn't)
2. **Firefox** (different cookie handling)
3. **Safari** (if on Mac)
4. **Brave** (built-in ad blocking might help)

### 3. Network Solutions

- **Mobile Hotspot**: Often has different IP range
- **VPN**: Try different locations (US East Coast often works best for Prismic)
- **Public WiFi**: Coffee shop, library (different IP)

### 4. DNS Change

```bash
# Windows
1. Network Settings → Change adapter options
2. Right-click your connection → Properties
3. Internet Protocol Version 4 → Properties
4. Use: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google DNS)
```

## If Nothing Works

### Manual Field Addition via Support

1. Email Prismic support with:
   - Repository name: hundred-days-challenge
   - Request: Add "website_link" field to Author custom type
   - CloudFront Request ID: FB148GEGGl0Ortc1hAw-5IAvyGR6G25hlyviyQKNKkALpbNJD8txZA==

### Temporary Workaround

Until you can access Prismic, the website_link field won't work, but your code is ready.
The field is already defined locally and will work once synced.

### Time-Based Solution

CloudFront blocks often expire after:

- 1-2 hours (rate limiting)
- 24 hours (security blocks)

Try again tomorrow from a different browser/network combination.
