# Task 05: Security Audit and Dependency Management

## Priority: High

## Description
Implement comprehensive dependency security scanning, vulnerability management, and secure coding practices throughout the application.

## Dependencies
- Task 03: Security Headers
- Task 04: Authentication Security

## Implementation Steps

### 1. **Set Up Dependency Scanning**
   - Configure npm audit in package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "security:audit": "npm audit --production",
     "security:fix": "npm audit fix --force",
     "security:check": "npm audit --audit-level=moderate"
   }
   ```

### 2. **Implement Dependabot Configuration**
   - Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: "npm"
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: "weekly"
       security-updates-only: true
       open-pull-requests-limit: 10
   ```

### 3. **Create Security Policy**
   - Create `SECURITY.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Security Policy
   
   ## Supported Versions
   | Version | Supported          |
   | ------- | ------------------ |
   | 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
   
   ## Reporting a Vulnerability
   Contact: security@yourproject.com
   Response Time: 48 hours
   ```

### 4. **Implement Code Security Scanning**
   - Add to `.gitignore`:
   ```
   # Security
   .env.local
   .env.production
   secrets/
   ```
   
   - Create pre-commit hooks for secret scanning

### 5. **Secure Build Process**
   - Update build scripts:
   ```typescript
   - Remove source maps in production
   - Minimize bundle information exposure
   - Enable webpack security plugins
   ```

### 6. **Client-Side Security**
   - Create `src/lib/client-security.ts`:
   ```typescript
   - Implement DOMPurify for user content
   - Add XSS protection utilities
   - Secure local storage usage
   ```

### 7. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement security logging:
   ```typescript
   - Log security events
   - Monitor suspicious activities
   - Set up alerts for violations
   ```

## Security Checklist

### Dependencies
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in production deps
- [ ] Automated dependency updates configured
- [ ] Security advisories monitored
- [ ] Lock files are committed

### Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Environment variables properly used
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] No console.logs in production

### Build Security
- [ ] Source maps disabled in production
- [ ] Bundle analysis shows no secrets
- [ ] Build process is reproducible
- [ ] CI/CD secrets are secure

### Runtime Security
- [ ] User input is always sanitized
- [ ] No eval() or dynamic code execution
- [ ] Proper error boundaries

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Set up monitoring for:
- Failed authentication attempts
- CSP violations
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### Regular Security Tasks
- Weekly: Run npm audit
- Monthly: Review security logs
- Quarterly: Full security audit
- Yearly: Penetration testing

## Success Criteria
- Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Security policy documented
- Regular dependency updates
- No exposed secrets or sensitive data
- Monitoring and alerting configured
